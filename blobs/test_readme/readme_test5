Test a cylinder placed in the 15 - 24.4 km region that is 450 km wide and centred at the depth halfway in this layer and
halfway along the propagation path. Cylinder made by creating a sphere and then restricting it to the layer

Used a 1 crust prem background model and perturbed the density + kappa + mu to that of with the 2900 density from
PREM 2C -- note here this isnt a PERFECT test because I then compare it against the results from PREM1C and PREM2C

Evidently the PREM1C and PREM2C are vary in both kappa/mu/rho and alpha/beta where as our model is
perturbing rho/kappa/mu while keeping alpha/beta the same.

A final final test would be to allow both to vary since we are only really affect the density here
which we put in as test 5 part 2

We allow for this updated vp/vs/rho version by introducting rhoblob_custom_vp
# To repeat part one of this test (only rho changing) you can switch
rhoblob_custom_vp = 1.0
rhoblob_custom_vs = 1.0
