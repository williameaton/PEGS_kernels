test 2 is a blob that is very close to the source but slightly offset to only hit one of the
lobes of the rho_not_prime kernel
- Next moved blob to close to the source (centre slightly offset so it was meant to hit one of the two lobes
  in the 2-lobed rho knl (rho, kappa, mu). I accidently left the radius at 100 km for the blob making it
  contain both the positive and negative lobes and basically no difference was observed in the waveforms
    + this is not necessarily what we were expecting based on the kernels
    + one suggestion is the negative and positive blobs are cancelling out but might just not be having any effect
