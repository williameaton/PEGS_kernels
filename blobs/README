### Blobs

This directory hosts results and some analysis from a suite of tests used to check the PEGS sensitivity kernels. We add
a 'blob' of perturbed material at different places to see how it affects the PEGS signals and the misfit function
i.e. is it consistent with what is predicted by the sensitivity kernels

#### Files:

- anything with _cbl is computing the blob location
- readme_test{i} details the specific test
