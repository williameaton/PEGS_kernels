This directory hosts a number of imaginary Earth models that were tested during communication with Shenjian Zhang:

- AK135_wei: Model used in Zhang et al., 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116150)
- AK135_1Cpremcrust: AK135_wei with crust replaced by upper crustal values from PREM model

- PREM_2_crust: isotropic elastic PREM with ocean replaced by upper crustal material
- PREM_1_crust: same as PREM_2_crust except the lower-crustal layer (15-24.4 km) contains upper crustal values

# Other files:

- plot_models.py: loads the above models and produces the plot comparing models in upper 1000 km
- models.pdf: output from plot_models.py
