# In this directory we run a test to check that the adjoint gravity solver is working correctly.
# Essentially the idea is to use:

(1) Use a force source in the forward solver and record the wavefield
(2) Instead of applying an adjoint force, we can apply the same force as the 'adjoint' force which should produce
    the same wavefield, albeit reversed in time

This will tell us if our adjoint gravity is working -- which it is!
