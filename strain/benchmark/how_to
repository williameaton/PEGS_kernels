# To do the benchmarks:

-- NEX256 input files are provided. Need ~ 4400 timesteps to produce HS stations, but ~ 10000 for all PEGS stations

To produce QSSP:
-- input file is provided. Run simulation.
-- run script convert_to_per_station.py to convert the big .dat file to a station-wise set of files
-- Run FD_h_qpegs.py to compute strain using Zhang method if desired. Note that I added in an extra output
   that outputs the strain before it has been time-integrated. THIS is what is compared in my plots in NZE
